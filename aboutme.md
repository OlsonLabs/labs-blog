My name is Bill Nelson. I was born and raised in Reno, NV, and went to The University of Nevada Reno for Computer Science.  Right out of college I landed a programming job (thanks to my buddy), at the largest casino gaming company.  I worked there for 14 years on projects ranging from multiplayer electronic table games to optimizing BIOS code to writing drivers.  It was a lot of fun, I made a lot of friends, but you know how the adage goes... you leave a boss, not a job.

I had the opportunity to join my husband in his Real Estate company.  My job is systems.  If you do a regular task, you should automate it, and while you are at it, why not hook up some APIs, and create a product that connects all the disparate systems into one glorious beast.  That is the ultimate goal.

This blog is about that journey.  There may be posts about Real Estate specific topics, but we will analyze it as a scientist and ask; Can we make this better?  Can we use this to hone our craft?  Can we turn this into a new tool to gain an edge in the industry?
